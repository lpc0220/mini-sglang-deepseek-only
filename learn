  - External agent extensions (like your code-simplifier)                                               
  - Add specialized agent types to the Task tool

  - Can be added/configured via /mcp                                                                    
                                                                                                        
  From your /context output:                                                                            
  System tools: 16.1k tokens    ← Built-in tools                                                        
  MCP tools: 293 tokens         ← IDE integration (getDiagnostics, executeCode)                         
  Custom agents: 49 tokens      ← Plugins (code-simplifier)                                             
  Memory files: 2.7k tokens     ← CLAUDE.md context                                                     
                                                                                                        
  So: Tools = core capabilities, Skills = slash command workflows, Plugins = custom agents you install.
